"""A collection of modules for building different kinds of tree from
HTML documents.

To create a treebuilder for a new type of tree, you need to do
implement several things:

1) A set of classes for various types of elements: Document, Doctype,
Comment, Element. These must implement the interface of
_base.treebuilders.Node (although comment nodes have a different
signature for their constructor, see treebuilders.etree.Comment)
Textual content may also be implemented as another node type, or not, as
your tree implementation requires.

2) A treebuilder object (called TreeBuilder by convention) that
inherits from treebuilders._base.TreeBuilder. This has 4 required attributes:
documentClass - the class to use for the bottommost node of a document
elementClass - the class to use for HTML Elements
commentClass - the class to use for comments
doctypeClass - the class to use for doctypes
It also has one required method:
getDocument - Returns the root node of the complete document tree

3) If you wish to run the unit tests, you must also create a
testSerializer method on your treebuilder which accepts a node and
returns a string containing Node and its children serialized according
to the format used in the unittests

                       a xml.dom.minidom based implementation.
               "etree" - A generic builder for tree implementations exposing an

                         xml.etree.cElementTree if available and

                        limitations of lxml's implementation.
