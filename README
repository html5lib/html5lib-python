html5lib is a pure-python library for parsing HTML. It is designed to
conform to the Web Applications 1.0 specification, which has
formalized the error handling algorithms of popular web browsers.

 = Installation =

html5lib is packaged with distutils. To install it use:
 $ python setup.py install

 = Tests =

You may wish to check that your installation has been a success by
running the testsuite. All the tests can be run by invoking
runtests.py in the tests/ directory

 = Usage =

Simple usage follows this pattern:

import html5lib

f = open("mydocument.html")

parser = html5lib.HTMLParser()
document = parser.parse(f)

By default, the returned document is a simple DOM-like structure which
can be navigated using the .parent and .childNode attributes on each
element. 

It is also possible to generate an ElementTree tree, this requires the use of the "tree" argument to the parser:

from html5lib.treebuilders import etree
parser = html5lib.HTMLParser(tree=etree.TreeBuilder)

Intrepid users may write their own treebuilder implementations - see
help(html5lib.treebuilders) for more information

More documentation is avaliable in the docstrings.
